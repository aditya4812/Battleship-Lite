# Battleship-Lite
Non-GUI Battleship Game (JAVA).
Created a fully operational 1-player version of the board game Battleship as a personal project. 
The game is written entirely in Java, utilizing advanced concepts like efficient memory allocation, 
constantly changing arrays, and maximizing speed while creating many objects and handling their classes. 
2 Player game mode currently in development.
